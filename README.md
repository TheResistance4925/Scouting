This contains all files and media (assets included) used to build the 4925 crescendo scouting app. This app was built and developed in Unity, and we would love feedback and suggestions for improvement.
This app is specifically for the collection of scouting data, which it turns into a QR code that can be pasted into a spreadsheet and turned into a CSV file to be analyzed, the program we use for analyzation is also available on our GitHub.
